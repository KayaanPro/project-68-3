It is a contributing property in the Midtown Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places and it is listed as a City Landmark in St. Louis</p>

    <p class="text-muted">One of the core values here at St Francis Xavier School is the belief that every child deserves access to a high quality education. Once a week the students have the opportunity to visit the school library and take out 2 books. Books are to be returned to school on Wednesday for a Thursday visit to the school library.</p>

    <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Was established in 1982</h5>
    <p class="text-muted">The college stage and auditorium that you see today, has come through a historic process of evolution and gradual transformation. The earliest roots of this stage goes back to the ‘Sans Soucci Theatre’, which was burned down by fire in 1843. But the spirit of Sans Soucci survived the holocaust, and in 1859, when the premises became the property of Belgain Jesuits, who called it St. Xavier’s, theatre came to life again. Our students love The School Auditorium and we hope you do too.</p>
